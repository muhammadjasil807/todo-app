To-Do App (React + Vite)
A simple **To-Do List** built using **React** and **Vite**

Project Overview
This project builds a **basic to-do application** to practice core React concepts such as:

* Component-based architecture
* State management using React Hooks
* Handling user input and events
* Dynamic rendering using lists
* Clean UI styling with CSS

Technologies Used
* **React** – UI library
* **Vite** – Fast development build tool
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Application logic
* **CSS3** – Styling and layout
* **React Hooks (useState)** – State management
